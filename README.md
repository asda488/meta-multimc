Repository for MultiMC Minecraft package metadata (ARM64)

This repository is modified metadata for ARM64. As such, do not link to this repository when building MultiMC for x86_64 else the minecraft .jar will not load (more precisely the correct libraries will not be installed).

This repo may be out-of-date. If so, please fork JJTech0130/meta-multimc or this and replace everything except the `org.lwjgl` and `org.lwjgl3` folders with newer versions. Alternatively, feel free to open an issue.

Most importantly however, thank you to JJTech0130 and MultiMC for the great work!
